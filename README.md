# Spotify Redesign 
---
This is built with React Native right now so that way I can showcase how it should work on everything.
I'm doing research and looking for Spotify's color palette. What I'm finding is that there are too many not certain colors so let's remove this problem and only do a few colors. Only the essentials. 4/13/25
